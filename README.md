# ScriptsOnStartService

A systemd service to run scripts at startup.

## Installation

`curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoli51/TelegramBotService/main/install.sh" | sudo bash`

## Use

Here is how you can run your scripts at startup:

1. Create a folder for your bot in the `/home/StartupScripts` folder.
2. In your bot folder you should put the code of your bot.
3. Create a `run.sh` script in your folder.
4. Tada :)

The configuration is very generic and can run arbitrarty scripts. So be careful what you put in there :).
